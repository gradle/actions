        'generate-and-upload': Generates a dependency graph for the project and saves it as a workflow artifact.
        'download-and-submit': Retrieves a previously saved dependency-graph and submits it to the repository.

      The `generate-and-upload` and `download-and-submit` options are designed to be used in an untrusted workflow scenario,
